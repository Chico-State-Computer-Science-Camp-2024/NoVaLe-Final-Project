	    <h4>Info about SoulBox</h4>
        <dl>
	        <dt>Soul Box is a free website that offers simple and stress-free activities. There are mini-games based on various de-stressors such as meditation and sleep aids, tasks that promote forgiveness and thankfulness, words of affirmation, and breathing exercises to ease anxiety. All tasks are presented together as a “home”, with different rooms holding different activities, such as:</dt>
	        <dd>- The garden provides a forgiveness/de-stressing activity, being illustrated as pulling weeds.</dd>
	        <dd>- The kitchen has (will have) a cooking activity where you type things you are grateful for, it is presented as adding ingredients into a stew.</dd>
	        <dd>- The living room presents a TV that gives affirmations that repeat as well as inspiring quotes (in the future).</dd>
	        <dd>- The bathroom shows a breathing exercise illustrated as bubbles popping in a bathtub (later).</dd>
